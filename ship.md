# Ship Changes

Automate the full PR workflow: commit, push, create PR, review, and merge.

## Your Task

Ship the current changes with optional commit message: $ARGUMENTS

## Local Configuration

**Check for project-specific config:** If `.claude/ship-config.md` exists, read it first. It may specify:

- Default base branch (if not `main`)
- Required reviewers before merge
- Branch naming conventions
- Auto-merge rules (e.g., only for certain file types)
- Custom PR title/body templates
- Skip review for certain changes (e.g., docs-only)
- **CI configuration** (see below)
- **Test configuration** (see below)

### CI Configuration

Control CI setup via `.claude/ship-config.md`:

```markdown
## CI Settings

ci: none
```

**Options:**
- `ci: none` - Don't create CI workflow, no CI requirement in branch protection
- `ci: node` - Node.js template with npm test/coverage (default if `package.json` exists)
- `ci: flutter` - Flutter template with flutter test (default if `pubspec.yaml` exists)
- `ci: skip` - Don't touch CI at all (keep existing or none)
- `ci: custom` - Use custom template defined in config (see below)

**Custom CI template:**
```markdown
## CI Settings

ci: custom

### Custom CI Workflow
\`\`\`yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: make test
\`\`\`
```

**Defaults (no config file):**
- If `pubspec.yaml` exists → `ci: flutter`
- If `package.json` exists → `ci: node`
- If neither → `ci: none`
- If `.github/workflows/` already has files → don't overwrite

### Test Configuration

Control pre-commit test runs via `.claude/ship-config.md`:

```markdown
## Test Settings

test-command: npm run test:coverage
```

**Options:**
- `test-command: <command>` - Run this exact command before committing. If it exits non-zero, stop and fix.
- `test-command: none` - Skip local tests entirely.

If not specified, auto-detect:
- Has `package.json` with a `test:coverage` script → `npm run test:coverage`
- Has `package.json` with a `test` script (no coverage) → `npm run test`
- Has `pubspec.yaml` → `flutter test`
- Neither → skip

Coverage thresholds are owned by the project's test runner config (e.g., `vitest.config.ts`, `jest.config.js`), not by `/ship`.

## Prerequisites

Source environment variables:

```bash
source ~/.enspyr-claude-skills/.env 2>/dev/null || source .env 2>/dev/null
```

Get repo info:

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q '.nameWithOwner')
BASE_BRANCH=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q '.defaultBranchRef.name')
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
```

## Workflow

### Step 0: Repository Setup (once per repo)

Check if this repo has been initialized for `/ship`:

```bash
# Check for initialization marker
if [ -f ".claude/ship-initialized" ]; then
  echo "Repo already initialized"
else
  echo "First run - checking repo setup..."
fi
```

**If not initialized**, set up branch protection and collaborators:

1. **Check current branch protection:**
   ```bash
   gh api repos/$REPO/branches/$BASE_BRANCH/protection 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. **Add reviewers as collaborators** (if not already):

   First check if reviewers are already collaborators:
   ```bash
   MAXWELL_IS_COLLAB=$(gh api repos/$REPO/collaborators/MaxwellMergeSlam 2>/dev/null && echo "yes" || echo "no")
   KELVIN_IS_COLLAB=$(gh api repos/$REPO/collaborators/KelvinBitBrawler 2>/dev/null && echo "yes" || echo "no")
   ```

   If reviewers need to be added and `ENSPYR_ADMIN_PAT` is available, invite and accept:
   ```bash
   # Invite reviewers (requires admin PAT)
   if [ -n "$ENSPYR_ADMIN_PAT" ]; then
     # Invite MaxwellMergeSlam
     curl -s -X PUT \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $ENSPYR_ADMIN_PAT" \
       -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
       "https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO/collaborators/MaxwellMergeSlam" \
       -d '{"permission":"push"}'

     # Invite KelvinBitBrawler
     curl -s -X PUT \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $ENSPYR_ADMIN_PAT" \
       -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
       "https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO/collaborators/KelvinBitBrawler" \
       -d '{"permission":"push"}'

     # Accept invitations
     MAXWELL_INVITE=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $MAXWELL_PAT" \
       "https://api.github.com/user/repository_invitations" | jq -r ".[] | select(.repository.full_name==\"$REPO\") | .id")
     [ -n "$MAXWELL_INVITE" ] && curl -s -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $MAXWELL_PAT" \
       "https://api.github.com/user/repository_invitations/$MAXWELL_INVITE"

     KELVIN_INVITE=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $KELVIN_PAT" \
       "https://api.github.com/user/repository_invitations" | jq -r ".[] | select(.repository.full_name==\"$REPO\") | .id")
     [ -n "$KELVIN_INVITE" ] && curl -s -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $KELVIN_PAT" \
       "https://api.github.com/user/repository_invitations/$KELVIN_INVITE"
   else
     echo "Note: ENSPYR_ADMIN_PAT not set. Ask a repo admin to add MaxwellMergeSlam and KelvinBitBrawler as collaborators."
   fi
   ```

3. **Create CI workflow** (based on config):

   Check `.claude/ship-config.md` for CI settings. If not specified, auto-detect:
   - Has `pubspec.yaml` → Flutter
   - Has `package.json` → Node.js
   - Neither → skip CI
   - `.github/workflows/` exists → don't overwrite

   **All CI templates should include:**
   - Trigger on push/PR to main
   - Docs-skip: detect if only .md/.txt/LICENSE changed, skip build/test if so
   - Run appropriate build, lint, and test commands for the stack
   - Job name: `test` (for branch protection)

   | Stack | Key steps |
   |-------|-----------|
   | Node.js | `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:coverage` |
   | Flutter | `flutter pub get`, `flutter analyze`, `flutter test --coverage` |

   Commit the CI file as part of setup.

4. **Configure coverage threshold:**

   If CI was created (not `ci: none` or `ci: skip`), ask the user what coverage threshold they want:

   > "What minimum coverage threshold should be enforced? (e.g., 50, 80, or 'none' to skip)"

   If the user provides a number, configure the project's test runner:

   **Vitest** (`vitest.config.ts` or `vitest.config.js`):
   - If the file exists, add or update the `test.coverage.thresholds` section
   - If no vitest config exists but `package.json` has vitest as a dependency, create `vitest.config.ts`:
     ```typescript
     import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

     export default defineConfig({
       test: {
         coverage: {
           provider: 'v8',
           thresholds: {
             lines: <threshold>,
             functions: <threshold>,
             branches: <threshold>,
             statements: <threshold>,
           },
         },
       },
     });
     ```

   **Jest** (`jest.config.js` or `jest.config.ts` or `package.json` jest section):
   - Add `coverageThreshold.global` with `branches`, `functions`, `lines`, `statements` set to the threshold

   **Flutter** (`pubspec.yaml` project):
   - Coverage thresholds aren't built into `flutter test`. Note this to the user — they can use a package like `very_good_cli` or add a coverage check script to CI.

   If the user says "none", skip. Store the chosen threshold in `.claude/ship-config.md`:
   ```markdown
   ## Test Settings

   coverage-threshold: 50
   ```

5. **Set up branch protection** (if missing):

   If CI was created, require it to pass:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/$REPO/branches/$BASE_BRANCH/protection -X PUT \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
     -f "required_pull_request_reviews[required_approving_review_count]=1" \
     -f "required_pull_request_reviews[dismiss_stale_reviews]=true" \
     -f "enforce_admins=false" \
     -f "required_status_checks[strict]=true" \
     -f "required_status_checks[contexts][]=test" \
     -f "restrictions=null"
   ```

   If no CI (ci: none), skip the status checks requirement:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/$REPO/branches/$BASE_BRANCH/protection -X PUT \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
     -f "required_pull_request_reviews[required_approving_review_count]=1" \
     -f "required_pull_request_reviews[dismiss_stale_reviews]=true" \
     -f "enforce_admins=false" \
     -f "required_status_checks=null" \
     -f "restrictions=null"
   ```

6. **Create initialization marker:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude
   echo "initialized=$(date -Iseconds)" > .claude/ship-initialized
   echo "reviewer=claude-reviewer-max" >> .claude/ship-initialized
   echo "ci=node|none|custom|skip" >> .claude/ship-initialized
   git add .claude/ship-initialized
   # If CI was created, also add it:
   git add .github/workflows/ci.yml 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

**Report setup status:**
- [x] Added claude-reviewer-max as collaborator
- [x] CI: created/skipped/existing (based on config)
- [x] Enabled branch protection (1 required review, +CI if applicable)
- [x] Created .claude/ship-initialized marker

### Step 1: Analyze Changes

Check what needs to be committed:

```bash
git status
git diff --stat
git diff --cached --stat
```

If there are no changes (staged or unstaged), report that there's nothing to ship and stop.

### Step 2: Run Tests

Before committing, run the local test suite to catch failures early (avoids a CI round-trip).

1. Check `.claude/ship-config.md` for `test-command` setting
2. If not configured, auto-detect:
   - Has `package.json` with `test:coverage` script → `npm run test:coverage`
   - Has `package.json` with `test` script only → `npm run test`
   - Has `pubspec.yaml` → `flutter test`
   - `test-command: none` or nothing detected → skip
3. Run the command. **If it exits non-zero, stop and fix before proceeding.** Do NOT commit broken code.

### Step 3: Create Commit

If there are uncommitted changes:

1. Stage all relevant changes (be selective - avoid secrets, large binaries)
2. Create a commit message:
   - Use the provided argument if given: `$ARGUMENTS`
   - Otherwise, analyze the diff and generate a descriptive commit message
   - Follow conventional commits format: `type(scope): description`

```bash
git add -A  # or specific files
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
commit message here

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

### Step 4: Push to Remote

Ensure the branch is pushed:

```bash
# Check if branch has upstream
if ! git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u} 2>/dev/null; then
  git push -u origin $CURRENT_BRANCH
else
  git push
fi
```

### Step 5: Create Pull Request

Check if a PR already exists for this branch:

```bash
EXISTING_PR=$(gh pr view --json number -q '.number' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
```

If no PR exists, create one:

```bash
gh pr create --title "PR title based on changes" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Brief description of changes

## Test plan
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Manual verification

Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
EOF
)"
```

Get the PR number:

```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number -q '.number')
```

### Step 6: Review the PR

Wait briefly for CI to start, then determine the review approach based on change size:

```bash
CHANGED_FILES=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json files --jq '.files | length')
CHANGED_LINES=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json additions,deletions --jq '.additions + .deletions')
```

**If large change (10+ files or 500+ lines changed):** before reviewing, run the "Pre-Step: Ensure Dual Review Setup" from `ship-major-feature.md` to bump required reviews to 2 and verify both reviewer bots are collaborators. Then run `/cage-match $PR_NUMBER`. After merging, run the "Post-Merge: Restore Branch Protection" step from `ship-major-feature.md` to restore required reviews back to 1.

**Otherwise:** run `/pr-review $PR_NUMBER`

Both will post review(s) to GitHub and return a verdict (APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or COMMENT). For cage match, both reviewers must APPROVE.

### Step 7: Handle Review Feedback

**If the review verdict is REQUEST_CHANGES:**

1. Automatically run `/review-respond $PR_NUMBER` to address each review comment
2. Commit and push the fixes
3. Re-request review and loop back to Step 6

Repeat until the review verdict is APPROVE.

**If the review verdict is APPROVE but there are suggestions:**

1. Show the suggestions to the user and ask if they want to address them before merging
2. If yes, run `/review-respond $PR_NUMBER`, commit, push, and re-request review
3. If no, continue to Step 9

### Step 8: Pre-Merge Gate (MANDATORY)

**STOP. Do NOT skip this step. Review suggestions are often valuable.**

Before merging, you MUST check:
- If verdict is **REQUEST_CHANGES** → go back to Step 7, do NOT merge
- If verdict is **APPROVE with suggestions** → list each suggestion to the user and ask "Do you want to address any of these before merging?" Wait for their answer. Do NOT auto-merge.
- If verdict is **APPROVE with no suggestions** → proceed to merge

### Step 9: Merge

**Only merge after the pre-merge gate is satisfied.**

If approved:

1. Check CI status:
   ```bash
   gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER
   ```

2. If CI passes (or no required checks), check for stacked PRs before merging:
   ```bash
   # Check if any open PRs use this branch as their base (stacked PRs)
   PR_BRANCH=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json headRefName -q '.headRefName')
   DOWNSTREAM_PRS=$(gh pr list --base "$PR_BRANCH" --json number -q '.[].number' 2>/dev/null)

   if [ -n "$DOWNSTREAM_PRS" ]; then
     # Stacked PRs exist — merge WITHOUT deleting branch, retarget downstream, then delete
     gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER --squash
     for downstream in $DOWNSTREAM_PRS; do
       gh pr edit $downstream --base $BASE_BRANCH
     done
     git push origin --delete "$PR_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || true
   else
     # No stacked PRs — safe to delete branch on merge
     gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER --squash --delete-branch
   fi
   ```

3. Report success with the merged PR URL.

## Output Format

Report progress at each step:

```markdown
## Shipping Changes

### Commit
- [x] Staged 3 files
- [x] Committed: "feat: add user authentication"

### Push
- [x] Pushed to origin/feature-branch

### Pull Request
- [x] Created PR #42: "feat: add user authentication"
- URL: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42

### Review
- [x] Code review: APPROVE
- Summary: Clean implementation, tests pass

### Merge
- [x] Merged PR #42 (squash)
- [x] Deleted branch: feature-branch

**Done! Changes shipped successfully.**
```

## Safety Checks

Before proceeding at each step, verify:

1. **Before commit:** No secrets or credentials in diff
2. **Before push:** Confirm we're not on main/master (create feature branch if needed)
3. **Before merge:** CI checks pass, review is APPROVE
4. **Abort conditions:**
   - If on protected branch without changes, stop
   - If review finds blocking issues, stop and report
   - If CI fails, stop and report

## Edge Cases

**Already on main with uncommitted changes:**
- Create a new feature branch first
- Name it based on the changes (e.g., `feat/add-auth`)

**PR already exists:**
- Push new commits to existing PR
- Re-review if there are new changes
- Proceed to merge if approved

**Multiple PRs (stacked):**
- When shipping multiple related PRs that are stacked (each PR's base is the previous PR's branch), merge them in order
- Before deleting a merged branch, check if any open PRs use it as their base
- If so: merge without `--delete-branch`, retarget downstream PRs to the base branch (e.g., `main`), then delete the branch
- This prevents downstream PRs from being auto-closed by GitHub when their base branch disappears

**No CLAUDE_REVIEWER_PAT:**
- Skip the formal review posting
- Still analyze the code and report findings
- Proceed to merge if self-review looks good (with warning)

**Cannot set up branch protection (not repo admin):**
- Skip the setup step
- Warn that reviews won't be enforced
- Still post advisory reviews and proceed

**Reviewers not set up and no ENSPYR_ADMIN_PAT:**
- Check if MaxwellMergeSlam/KelvinBitBrawler are already collaborators
- If not, and no admin PAT available, warn user to ask repo admin
- Reviews can still be posted but won't count for branch protection until reviewers have write access

**Repo already has branch protection:**
- Don't modify existing rules, except: verify `dismiss_stale_reviews` is enabled
- If not enabled, update it:
  ```bash
  DISMISS_STALE=$(gh api repos/$REPO/branches/$BASE_BRANCH/protection/required_pull_request_reviews 2>/dev/null | jq '.dismiss_stale_reviews')
  ```
  If `DISMISS_STALE` is not `true`, use the targeted PATCH endpoint to update just the review settings without touching other protection rules:
  ```bash
  curl -s -X PATCH \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ENSPYR_ADMIN_PAT" \
    -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
    "https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO/branches/$BASE_BRANCH/protection/required_pull_request_reviews" \
    -d '{"dismiss_stale_reviews":true}'
  ```
- Add collaborator if missing
- Mark as initialized

## Interactive Mode

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or unclear, ask the user:

1. What should the commit message be?
2. Should we auto-merge if review passes, or stop for manual approval?
